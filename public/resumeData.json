    "bio": "I am an entrepreneur at heart, with an incredible passion for innovation, an everlasting desire for knowledge, and a hope to impact the world. Born in the small town of Quincy, Illinois, I moved to Birmingham, Alabama to attend Samford University. While studying marketing and business, I spent an overwhelming amount of time focused on technology and software engineering. I love to build things, and I love to help others. I often work past the point of exhaustion, but I never tire. I have a longing passion to be a public speaker alongside my business innovations and technology habits. My mission: to create something that causes as much impact as the iPhone.",

After a freshman year, I realized I had little time to invest in music if I wished to fully dive into business software engineering. In my free time, I invested nearly every hour of the day to working on projects and businesses. It was during these times when I discovered the power of thinking differently."
